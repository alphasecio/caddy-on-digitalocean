# Static Website on DigitalOcean using Caddy Server
This example deploys a static website on DigitalOcean using Caddy server. For a step-by-step guide, see [this](https://alphasec.io/how-to-deploy-caddy-server-on-digitalocean-app-platform/) post.

By default, the `site/` directory gets deployed as a static site. This can be modified by changing the Dockerfile.
